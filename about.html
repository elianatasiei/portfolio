  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a web developer who got started by teaching myself how to build
    websites. Over time, I developed a passion for design and coding, which
    eventually led to an apprenticeship in web development. Through hands-on
    experience, I’ve refined my skills and now create websites that are both
    functional and user-friendly.
