          <h1>When You Feel Like Giving Up: Why Small Wins Matter</h1>
          <h4>Date: 26 November, 2024</h4>

          <p>
            <br />
            In web development, it’s easy to feel like you’re falling behind.
            There’s always someone faster, more experienced, or ahead of where
            you are right now. At times, it can be overwhelming, and the thought
            of giving up might start creeping in. I want to be transparent here
            because I know so many of you can relate to this. I’ve faced moments
            where I seriously doubted myself and wondered, “Do I really belong
            here?” Recently, I found myself in a situation where it felt like I
            wasn’t moving fast enough.<br /><br />
            At the place where I’m doing my internship, I was told there isn’t a
            spot for me because the developers there complete projects so
            quickly that they don’t feel there is the need for a junior dev
            right now. Hearing that was crushing. It’s hard not to feel like
            you’re not good enough, and it’s easy to think, “Maybe I’ll never be
            good enough.” But if I’ve learned one thing from this journey, it’s
            that you can’t let moments like these define your entire path.
            Instead, I try to focus on the progress I’ve made so far.<br /><br />
            I started this journey knowing absolutely nothing about coding. Now
            I can build functional websites and troubleshoot problems that used
            to completely stump me. Every small win—whether it’s learning a new
            concept or fixing a bug—reminds me that I’m growing, even when the
            process feels slow.<br /><br />
            This journey isn’t easy, and staying consistent takes effort. For
            me, having a designated workspace, sticking to routines, and leaning
            on a supportive community—like the one I found at 100Devs—has made
            all the difference. Knowing that others are working through the same
            challenges makes it easier to keep pushing forward.<br /><br />
            So, if you’re in that place where you feel like giving up, I want
            you to know you’re not alone. It’s okay to struggle. It’s okay to
            doubt yourself. But don’t let that stop you from moving forward.
            Reflect on the progress you’ve made, no matter how small it seems.
            Those little wins matter because they’re proof that you’re learning
            and growing. I know the path isn’t always smooth. Some days feel
            impossible. But trust me—it’s worth it. You’ve got this, and I’m
            right here rooting for you.

            <h1>The Intersection of UX Design and Web Development</h1>
          <h4>Date: 3 November, 2024</h4>
          <h4>Author: Eliana Atasiei</h4>
          <p>
            <br>As a web developer, I’ve always believed that a great website isn’t just about functionality—it’s about creating an experience that’s intuitive and user-friendly. To dive deeper into this, I recently completed a 3-week UX course by Accenture, and it was eye-opening.<br><br>
            
            Even though I’ve been focused on web development for a while, I realized that UX design plays an equally important role in creating successful websites. It’s not just about making things look good; it’s about making sure users can navigate effortlessly and enjoy the experience.
            
            The course helped me understand how to conduct user research, design effective wireframes, and gather user feedback. These are all crucial elements that guide the design process and ensure that the end result resonates with real users.
            
            <br><br>What I’ve learned is that web development and UX design are deeply connected. The challenge of creating clean code is just as demanding as designing an interface that’s functional and enjoyable to use. Combining these skills has made me a more well-rounded developer, and I now focus not just on building websites but on ensuring they provide seamless, positive user experiences.
            
            By bringing together design thinking and development, I can now create websites that not only function well but also provide a smooth and enjoyable experience for every user.</p>
