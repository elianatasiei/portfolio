# Welcome to my personal portfolio repository!

## This project serves as a digital showcase of my skills, projects, and creativity. It is a living, evolving project that I update regularly as I grow and learn.

# About This Portfolio

## Design Process

### The design of this portfolio was created using a combination of tools:

- **Figma**: I used Figma to sketch out and refine the layout, components, and overall user interface. This ensured a clean, consistent, and user-friendly design.
- **Logo Creation**: For the logo, I blended ideas from Figma and various free online logo makers to develop a unique design that aligns with my personal brand.
- **Illustrations**: The illustrations used in this portfolio are sourced from **unDraw**, a library of open-source illustrations. To align them with my portfolio's style and theme, I customized details such as colors to match the overall aesthetic and branding.

My design approach focuses on **simplicity**, **elegance**, and **functionality**, ensuring that the content takes center stage.

## Why Not WordPress?

### For this project, I decided not to use WordPress for several reasons:

- I wanted **complete control** over the design and code, which can be limiting with pre-built WordPress templates.
- This portfolio is a reflection of my development skills, so building it from scratch better showcases my technical abilities.
- The flexibility to add and customize features as I learn and grow is important to me, and WordPress doesnâ€™t align with that goal.

## Development Process

### This portfolio is entirely coded from scratch, using:

- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript** for the core structure, styling, and interactivity.
- The codebase is actively maintained, and I continuously add new features, optimize performance, and enhance responsiveness.
- **Hosting** is (going to be) handled by **Netlify**.
